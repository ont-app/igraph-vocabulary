# igraph-vocabulary

FIXME: Support for creating keyword identifiers (KWIs) in IGraph-compliant graphs and aligning them with URIs in the Linked Data world. 

## Overview

A KWI is a namespaced clojure keyword used exactly the way a URI is used in RDF. Ideally URI should be importable as KWIs and integrated into IGraph-based models, and conversely KWIs should be exportable as standard URIs. 

This builds on the ont-app.vocabulary library and the ont-app.igraph library, and is responsible for minimal functionality involving both. ont-app.igraph and ont-app.vocabulary should not know about each other.

Watch this space for more documentation.
