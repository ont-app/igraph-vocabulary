Require thus:

```
(ns ont-app.igraph-vocabulary.core-test
(:require 
  [
   [ont-app.igraph-vocabulary.core :as igv]
   ))
```

## Overview

A KWI is a namespaced clojure keyword used exactly the way a URI is
used in RDF. Ideally URI should be importable as KWIs and integrated
into IGraph-based models, and conversely KWIs should be exportable as
standard URIs.

This builds on the ont-app.vocabulary library and the ont-app.igraph
library, and is responsible for basic functionality involving
both. ont-app.igraph and ont-app.vocabulary should not know about each
other.
